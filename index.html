                    <h2>To Do or Not To Do?</h2>
                    <p>There are many risks with building and launching a product. The first risk is building something that there is no market for, or for a market you can't reach. Once you get past those risks, then you have to build the right product and sell it properly. But figuring out if there is a market for what you are building, is the #1 risk you should be focused on at the onset.
                      I will help you to figure this out, so you can make the first key decision you will face. After all, if you go ahead, you will likely be working on it for the next few years -- so you may as well take care of this risk as early as you can.

                    <p>
                      The truth of the matter is, you may be approaching the problem wrong. This problem may not be for you. Isn't it better you discover that during the planning process, than after many years and hundreds of thousands of dollars later?

                    <h2>I built and ran 5KMVP</h2>
                    <p>In 2012, I noticed that there was an increasing demand for service-providers that focus on building Minimum Viable Products (MVPs). I also thought any MVP could be built for just $5K. I was right on the former, and wrong on the latter.</p><br />
                    <!-- <p>Despite making a decent living over the years from 5KMVP, I realized that even though something can be built for $5K, it isn't always viable. So, I have decided to pivot. </p><br /> -->
                    <p>One of the great things that came out of this experience though, was that I eventually began charging for a "Scope of Work" creation phase. This served as a "mini-project" within the larger project, which clients loved. That "Scope of Work mini-project phase" was so successful that I decided to build an entire service focused on that. Welcome to My MVP Blueprint.</p><br />

                        At a crucial time in the campaign, when our message was resonating but more details were required than a 30-second soundbyte could provide, Marc, Djuvane and the 1GS Team worked quickly with us to condense all of the information we wanted to communicate into a clear, simple and straightforward website that proved to be a comprehensive, and singular resource that we could direct all queries about our plans to. The very clear information on the new website made it easy for voters to understand the JLP's 10-point plan and especially the cost and revenue cover of the PAYE tax exemption for those who earn $1.5M or less in basic salary.  This proved to be tremendously useful, and added an appropriate book-end to what many credit as being the most effective, digital campaign run in Jamaica's political history -- ultimately helping to secure the election.

                        Even though I built another company before, Marc helped me think through the many considerations for Kordli. Business - from the actual business model, to managing video storage/bandwidth costs along with many other considerations. Product - Actually building the bulk of the product. He also helped manage different resources (graphics, front-end devs, other Rails devs) that we brought on at various points throughout the project. He even helped me with my Ruby on Rails learning journey along the way. We are still figuring things out, but Marc’s advice has proved to be very valuable.

                      <p>When Marc became involved in OGNR, we were running out of cash because we were a self-funded operation and our hosting costs were skyrocketing due to the popularity of the news stories we ran. The bulk of the major costs were associated with the inefficient use of server resources. Marc rebuilt the entire product, and transitioned us from a $400/month AWS bill, to a $20/month Heroku bill. That rewrite bought us a lot of time. Marc also helped us think strategically about the global news industry and we explored many funding opportunities.</p>

                              but we will give you a blueprint and framework for how to think about different ways to achieve this, specific to your unique skillset.
